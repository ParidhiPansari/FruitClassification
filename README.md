# FruitClassification
#In this project, we aim to develop a Fruit Classification system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify and categorize various fruit types based on their images. The dataset comprises diverse fruit images for training and testing the CNN model. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the model undergoes a rigorous training process to learn distinctive features inherent to each fruit type. Following training, the system is subjected to testing, evaluating its ability to generalize and accurately classify unseen fruit images. The project not only emphasizes the implementation of a robust CNN model for image classification but also explores the broader applications of machine learning in automating fruit recognition processes, with potential benefits for agricultural practices, inventory management, and food industry quality control.
